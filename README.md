Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/treeview-with-checkboxes-and-various-events

The project is an example of working with a WPF TreeView whose items contain checkboxes.
Each item is bound to a Node object. When a Node objectâ€™s check state changes, it applies rules to the check state of its parent and child items.
This project also shows how to use various events such as check all, uncheck and invert all items and also expend and collapse all nodes.
